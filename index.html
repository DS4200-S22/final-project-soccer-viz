    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>
      With the help of modern data collection and machine learning, 
      new ways of quantifying the game of soccer have come to the forefront. 
      One of these metrics, called xG, quantifies the number of goals a team or player are expected to score based on the quality of chances they have. 
      Our project aim is to use this new and exciting statistic to provide both a high-level visualization of how teams performed, along with more specific player-based information of the past five seasons.

    <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
  
On the left is a scatter plot that represents performance data for teams. Points on the scatter plot represent different
teams. There is also a dotted line, (xG = xG Conceded), that runs diagonally across
the scatter plot. If a team is above this line, they are creating more/better goal scoring chances than they are conceding. When hovering the mouse on a team point, a tool-tip will appear that displays the season
and team name, along with the following data: xG per 90, xGc per
90, G per 90, Gc per 90, along with the record of the team over that
season.
The visualization on the right side
is a bar graph that is linked to the scatter plot. The bar chart reflects the burshing chosen by the user on the scatterplot
If the user selects a team/teams in the scatter plot, the bar graph will
be populated with player data from that respective team and season
combo. The bar plot will display
the top 30 xG per 90 players of the selected data on the scatter plot.
Lastly, when a user hovers over a bar, a tool-tip will appear with player data such
as name, position, nationality, and performance statistics such as G
per 90, xG per 90, A per 90, xA per 90, and 90s played.
