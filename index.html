    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p>
      By comparing expected goals to actual performance, users will be able to see which soccer teams are over or under
      performing. This project aims to compile data related to the top 5 European football leagues and create
      visualizations to represent performance at the team and individual player level. These visualizations will be
      useful to bring attention to undervalued players, as well as to teams that are beating expectations. The
      information gained from the visualizations can be used by itself or as a precursor for further analysis.

    <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>
  
The left side is a scatter plot that represents perfor-
mance data for teams. Points on the scatter plot represent different
teams. There is also a dotted line, (y=x), that runs diagonally across
the scatter plot. This is
so that users can determine if that team is creating more xG than
conceding. When hovering the mouse on a team
logo, a tool-tip will appear that displays the season
and team name, along with the following data, xG per 90, xGc per
90, G per 90, Gc per 90, along with the record of the team over that
season.
The visualization on the right side of the final visualization tool
is a bar graph that is linked to the scatter plot. The bar chart reflects the filter combinations chosen by the user on the scatter plot.
If the user selects a team in the scatter plot, the bar graph will
be populated with player data from that respective team and season
combo. If the user is in xG Output mode, the bar plot will display
the top 30 xG per 90 players of the selected data on the scatter plot.
Lastly, when
a user hovers over a bar, a tool-tip will appear with player data such
as name, position, nationality, and performance statistics such as G
per 90, xG per 90, A per 90, xA per 90, and 90s played.
